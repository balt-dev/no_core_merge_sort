# `no_core_merge_sort`

A "simple" Rust program that shows you a visualization of In-Place Merge Sort,
**written with `#![no_core]`**.

Unix only. Built on cargo 1.84.0-nightly (031049782 2024-11-01).

Use from the command line like `./mergevis <element count: int> <delay between swaps: double>`.

## Why!?

Honestly, getting to know the nitty-gritty details of how Rust works on a lower level
was really fun (save for having to debug ICEs).

It's definitely challenging, but I'd say it was worth it.
